# MachineLearningFromScratch

This repository contains a set of fundamental Machine Learning algorithms implemented from scratch using Numpy.

## Motivation

As an aspiring ML Engineer, I wanted a deeper understanding of the various ML algorithms used in the industry today. I figured the best way to accomplish this is to code these algorithms up myself!

## Dependencies

Here is a list of Python libraries needed to run these notebooks:

- Numpy
- Scipy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Mpl_toolkits
- Seaborn

## Credits

Much of this code is influenced by Andrew Ng's Matlab coding exercises from his Machine Learning class on Coursera.
